# Ein

A lightweight machine learning library designed as a solo college project. It features essential data preprocessing tools, linear regression, principal component analysis (PCA), and reinforcement learning with Q-tables.

Main files:

    Ein.hpp: Header file
    Ein.tpp: Implementation of template classes
    Ein.cpp: Implementation of other classes

A test file is provided to validate most features of the library, except for the Q-learning implementation.
